I've written a quick Python script for converting entries in a .bib file to markdown language (actually wrote it for the [Publications](https://gjsoto.github.io/publications) page of this website)! 

The project can be found at [this page](https://github.com/gjsoto/B2MD) and is still a work in progress.
